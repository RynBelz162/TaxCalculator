# ðŸ§® TaxCalculator

This Xamarin Forms app uses the TaxJar API to calculate the tax rate for a specified location and the tax to collect for an order.

### Things I would improve with more time
- I would most likely add some form of local caching for location rates.
- I would like to incorporate a nicer loading animation.
- I would like to improve the result UI instead of just displaying a label.

### Some issues I noticed that I would fix with more time
- Calculating an order tax between two states returns 0 sometimes. Not sure if this is correct or maybe I am calling TaxJar wrong.
- The disabled button on the order page does not calculate the amount and shipping validation correctly sometimes.
